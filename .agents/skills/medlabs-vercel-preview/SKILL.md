# MedLabs Vercel Preview

## Scope

This skill is PREVIEW ONLY.

Use it only when the active task explicitly authorizes a Vercel Preview.

## Preconditions

Before any preview deployment:

1. identify the current Git branch;
2. identify the exact source SHA;
3. verify the intended MedLabs Vercel project linkage;
4. verify that no production deployment flag or production alias operation is
   present.

## Allowed

An explicitly authorized Vercel Preview deployment for rendered, responsive,
accessibility, or user visual validation.

## Forbidden

Never:

- use `--prod`;
- assign or change a production alias;
- merge branches;
- implicitly Git push;
- mutate Supabase production;
- modify production environment variables;
- describe preview state as production truth.

## Result

Report:

- source Git SHA;
- preview URL;
- rendered validation actually performed.

Preview evidence does not prove production state.
